Aggregate functions are used perform some kind of mathematical or statistical calculation across a group of rows. The rows in each group are determined by the different values in a specified column or columns.  Alternatively you can aggregate across the t
entire table.

If we wanted to know the minimum, average and maximum age values (numage) across the whole SN7577 table we could write a table such as this;

## The `Distinct` keyword 

## The `group by` clause to summarise data

## Using built-in statistical functions

## Using the `having` clause
