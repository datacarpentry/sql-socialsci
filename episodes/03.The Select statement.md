## Definition of SQL 
SQL or Structured Query Language is an internatinal standard for manipulating data in a relational database.
Each Relational Database system like Oracle, MySQL or SQLite implements its own variation of the standard.

Fortunateley for the types of commands and queries that we will to write, all of the implementations are much in agreement.
The relatively straightforward Select queries we will be writing to access data in our SQLite database will execute un-altered in many of the other environments.

Essentially you only have to learn SQL once.

## SQL and Relational database tables

The strength of SQL is that a single SQL statement or query can request data be returned from one or much of the tables in the database. You can essentially define the relationships between tables on-the-fly as part of your query statement.

## DDL and DML


## Simple SQL queries useing the Select statement

~~~ 
Select *
From SN7577
~~~ 
{: .sql}

~~~ 
Select web1, web2, web3, web4
From SN7577
~~~ 
{: .sql}

The '*' character acts as a wildcard meaning all of the columns but you cannot use it as a general wildcard.
So for example, the following is not valid.
~~~ 
Select w*
From SN7577
~~~ 
{: .sql}

If you run it you will get an error.
When an error does occur you will see an alert box pop-up with a rather technical an unreadable error message in it. How ever when you close it, you will see a far simpler interpretation of the error in the Last Error text box. 


## Using more complex logical expressions in the `where` clause

## Sorting results
