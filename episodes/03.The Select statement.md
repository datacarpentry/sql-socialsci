## Definition of SQL 

## SQL and Relational database tables

## DDL and DML

## Simple SQL queries useing the Select statement

~~~ 
Select *
From SN7577
~~~ 
{: .sql}

~~~ 
Select web1, web2, web3, web4
From SN7577
~~~ 
{: .sql}

The '*' character acts as a wildcard meaning all of the columns but you cannot use it as a general wildcard.
So for example, the following is not valid.
~~~ 
Select w*
From SN7577
~~~ 
{: .sql}

If you run it you will get an error.
When an error does occur you will see an alert box pop-up with a rather technical an unreadable error message in it. How ever when you close it, you will see a far simpler interpretation of the error in the Last Error text box. 


## Using more complex logical expressions in the `where` clause

## Sorting results
