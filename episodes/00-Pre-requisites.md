## Introduction

## Install the Firefox SQLite plugin 

If you do not have Firefox already installed on your machine, it can be downloaded from [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/).

Start Firefox and navigate to the [plugin homepage for SQLite](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/). Assuming you do this from within the Firefox browser you will be able to install the plugin directly from the page by clicking the Add to Firefox button.
