## Introduction

## Install the Firefox SQLite plugin 

If you do not have Firefox already installed on your machine, it can be downloaded from [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/).

Start Firefox and navigate to the [plugin homepage for SQLite](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/). Assuming you do this from within the Firefox browser you will be able to install the plugin directly from the page by clicking the Add to Firefox button.

Having done this, the download occurs automatically but you will be asked to confirm that you want to install the plugin. You will then be asked to restart the Firefox browser. After the restart, from the tools menu you will be able to access the SQLite manger plugin.

By default the plugin opens in a new tab on the browser. This can be changed by selecting Tools | Options from within SQLiteManager selecting start in a new window.

## Invoke the Firefox SQLite plugin

The SQLiteManager plugin can be started at anytime from the firefox browser as indicated above. If you have chosen to have it start as a seperate window, then it is independent of the browser which can be closed at any time.
