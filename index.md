This is an alpha lesson to teach Data Management with SQL for Social Scientists,
We welcome and criticism, or error; and will take your feedback into account to
improve both the presentation and the content.

Databases are useful for both storing and using data effectively. Using a
relational database serves several purposes.

 - It keeps your data separate from your analysis. This means there’s no risk of
   accidentally changing data when you analyze it.
 - If we get new data we can rerun a query to find all the data that meets
   certain criteria.
 - It’s fast, even for large amounts of data.
 - It improves quality control of data entry (type constraints and use of forms
   in Access, Filemaker, etc.)
 - The concepts of relational database querying are core to understanding how to
   do similar things using programming languages such as R or Python.

This lesson will teach you what relational databases are, how you can load data
into them and how you can query databases to extract just the information that
you need.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> We expect you to have learn a bit about the SAFI dataset in the spreadsheet
> and OpenRefine session. It is not necessary, but will greatly improve your
> ability to understand the power of SQL and when to use it versus another tool.
